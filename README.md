# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Who am I?
I am a new web developer, I know HTML, CSS and JS. I am, however, looking to branch out into Obj-C.
## Why are there so few repositories?
Well, to be honest, there are way more private repos, I just hide website repos and personal project repos which are not done yet. Once a project is high enough quality or done, I will make the repo public.
