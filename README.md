# Hi there 👋
## Who am I? 🙋‍♀️
I am a new web developer, I know HTML, CSS and JS. I am learning the React MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) stack. Afterwards, I will learn ElectronJS
## Why are there so few repositories? 🤔
Well, to be honest, there are way more private repos, I just hide website repos and personal project repos which are not done yet. Once a project is high enough quality or done, I will make the repo public.
